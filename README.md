# 💸 Payment App – A Learning Project ☕

>☕✨ P.S. This README was brewed with the help of GPT—because while I'm busy coding with curly hair and coffee, why not let the AI handle the docs? 😉

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack payment application** built to understand and practice modern web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The goal was to create a smooth user experience for actions like user signup, authentication, searching users, and transferring money between accounts.

It’s not a Paytm clone—this is a unique **learning-focused payment app** that simulates real-world banking mechanics.
